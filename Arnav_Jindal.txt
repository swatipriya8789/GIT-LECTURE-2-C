Good morning. My name is Arnav Jindal, and I am a fresher student at NST Rishihood University, pursuing Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey is helping me build a strong foundation in technology and innovation.

I possess skills in Python programming, problem-solving, data analysis, teamwork, leadership, and effective communication. While I am at the beginning of my professional journey, I am eager to explore projects and gain hands-on experience that will allow me to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

Beyond academics, I enjoy playing badminton, swimming, and spending time with friends through gaming. These activities help me stay active, balanced, and collaborative.

I am excited to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully in the field of computer science and AI. Thank you.
